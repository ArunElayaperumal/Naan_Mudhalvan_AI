# Sentiment Analysis with Logistic Regression

This project demonstrates sentiment analysis using logistic regression on Twitter airline sentiment data.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the code on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Python (3.x recommended)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional)
- Required Python packages (install using pip or conda):
    - pandas
    - numpy
    - scikit-learn
    - nltk

### Installation

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Install the required Python packages using the following command:

   bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn nltk
   

3. Download the dataset 'Tweets.csv' from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crowdflower/twitter-airline-sentiment) and place it in the project directory.

### Running the Code

1. Open a command prompt or terminal.

2. Navigate to the project directory where the code is located.

3. Run the code using Python:

   bash
   python Sentimental_Analysis.py
   

   Replace your_script_name.py with the name of the Python script that contains the code you provided.

### Note

- You can also run the code in a Jupyter Notebook if you prefer a Jupyter environment. Simply open the Jupyter Notebook and import the notebook file.

## Code Explanation

- Sentimental_Analysis.py: This is the Python script that contains the code for sentiment analysis using logistic regression.

- The code preprocesses the Twitter airline sentiment dataset, trains a logistic regression model, and evaluates its performance using classification metrics.
